NCT02484560,Efficacy of Stem Cell Therapy in Ambulatory and Non-ambulatory Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - Phase 1-2,,UNKNOWN,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked genetic disorder primarily affecting males, resulting in an absence of dystrophin which ultimately leads to progressive muscle degeneration. Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently.",False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,DRUG,Biological: Umbilical Cord Based Allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cell,"Degree of improvement in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy after stem cell therapy treatment administered using Northstar Ambulatory Assessment, Magnetic Resonance Imaging & Spectroscopy, muscle strength assessment equipment, and a questionnaire.",,University of Gaziantep,"Istınye University, Cukurova University, Yıldırım Beyazıt University, Gaziantep Deva Hospital, Gaziantep Public Hospital",MALE,8 Years,14 Years,CHILD,PHASE1,10,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,TREATMENT,56733164/203,,2015-06,2015-12,2015-12,2015-06-29,,2015-07-01,2024-11-18T16:51:45.280759
NCT05305976,Telerehabilitation in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,Duchenne,COMPLETED,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive inherited disease that affects the muscles and causes functional limitations to varying degrees. It is vital to start physiotherapy follow-ups immediately after diagnosis. Patients with DMD are among the most vulnerable groups who have problems in accessing physiotherapy services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the telerehabilitation program developed to protect the physical health of patients with DMD and not to interrupt their follow-up.,False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,OTHER,Telerehabilitation,"Functional level, Socio-demographics, Walking test (Before intervention), Walking test (After intervention), Time to stand up from the supine position (Before intervention), Time to stand up from the supine position (After intervention), Modified upper extremity performance test (Before intervention), Modified upper extremity performance test (After intervention), Endurance (Before intervention), Endurance (After intervention), Pulmonary Dysfunction Test (Before intervention), Pulmonary Dysfunction Test (After intervention)",Patient Satisfaction Survey,Karadeniz Technical University,,MALE,5 Years,,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,43,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,PREVENTION,KTU_FTR_AE_01,,2021-01-11,2021-11-15,2022-01-01,2022-03-31,,2022-03-31,2024-11-18T16:51:45.280759
