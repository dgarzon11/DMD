NCT04322357,Twice Weekly Steroids and Exercise as Therapy for DMD,,RECRUITING,The study team will determine the potential of low dose twice weekly prednisone and whether exercise training can synergize to delay disease progression and improve muscle strength/physical function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Current standard of care (daily prednisone) is associated with adverse side effects. Evidence from DMD mouse models suggest that weekly dosing provides same efficacy without side effects. Appropriate exercise may also benefit but this area has not been adequately explored.,False,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD),"DRUG, BEHAVIORAL, DRUG","Prednisone, In-home Exercise Training, Prednisone plus exercise",Change in BMI,,University of Florida,U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command,MALE,5 Years,9 Years,CHILD,PHASE2,89,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,IRB201901339,"MD 180023, OCR27142",2020-07-30,2025-01-05,2025-10-07,2020-03-26,,2024-11-06,2024-11-21T07:18:56.998255
NCT05715957,Follow-up Study on Female Carriers With DMD Gene Variants,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are X-linked recessive allelic disorders caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene on chromosome Xp21. Female carriers may pass on the pathogenic variant to their daughters, resulting in a significant number of female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants. There was a large variability in the severity of symptoms with some being asymptomatic and some having severe symptoms. Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) might explain some of this variability. But now, the underlying cause of the large variability in phenotype is therefore uncertain.

Aim

1. To describe the change over a 6-year follow-up period in the structure and function of the heart and in function and muscle fat fraction in skeletal muscle of DMD/BMD carriers.
2. To explain the relationship between the XCI and the severity of the disease (phenotype).
3. To compare cardiac affection of female carriers of DMD/BMD to patients with BMD using new cardiac MRI techniques (spectroscopy and Dixon sequences).

Methods

This study contains three parts:

Part 1 is a 6-year follow-up on 53 genetically verified female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants initially investigated in 2016-2018 at Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet (Ethical journal no. H-16035677). In this part, the same 53 females will be investigated with the same measurements as 6 years ago to describe the progression of symptoms. All the follow-up results from this study will be compared to the results from 6 years ago.

In Part 2 a muscle biopsy will be taken from 1-3 muscles (see ""3.3.3 Description of outcomes) to investigate the XCI. To correlate the XCI to the phenotype, these patients will also undergo a muscle MRI and a Medical Research Council scale score for muscle strength (MRC).

In Part 3 The cardiac structure and function in patients with BMD will be investigated using a cardiac MRI to compare the findings with that of female carriers. An MRC will carried out to investigate if the heart affection correlates to the muscle affection.

Female carriers can decide whether to participate in Part 1, Part 2, or both. Patient with BMD can only participate in Part 3.",False,"Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Becker Muscular Dystrophy",OTHER,No intervention,"Change in fat fraction, Change in fibrosis in the heart, Change in LVEF/GLS-score, Correlation between XCI and phenotype, Cardiac status in patients with BMD vs carriers of variants in the DMD gene","Change in contractility, Change in blood concentrations, Change in blood concentrations, Change in blood concentrations, Change in blood concentrations, Change in blood concentrations, Change in lower extremity strength, Change in questionnaires on fatigue, Progression of electrocardiographic findings, Correlation between cardiac structure and function","Rigshospitalet, Denmark",,ALL,18 Years,,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,103,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,,98434,,2023-03-01,2024-08-01,2025-08-01,2023-02-08,,2023-02-09,2024-11-21T07:18:56.998255
NCT06363357,"The Effect of a Muscle-mimicking, Fabric-type Shoulder Orthosis on Functional Movements of the Upper Limb in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",,RECRUITING,"The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the effect of a muscle-mimicking, fabric-type shoulder orthosis on functional movements of the upper limb in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the impact of the muscle-mimicking, fabric-type shoulder orthosis on upper limb functional movements in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy?
* Are there observable differences in upper limb function when the shoulder orthosis is worn versus when it is not?

Participants will:

* Receive education on how to wear and use the shoulder orthosis.
* Undergo evaluations, including assessment of upper limb performance, shoulder muscle strength testing, active range of motion measurements, assessment of functional workspace, goal attainment scale evaluation, surface electromyography, physiological measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate, fatigue assessment, and assessment for any musculoskeletal or skin-related issues.

Researchers will compare Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients before and while wearing and operating the shoulder orthosis to see if there are any significant effects on variables such as upper limb function, range of motion, functional workspace, goal attainment scale, and surface electromyography.",False,"Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne, Orthotic Devices, Upper Extremity",DEVICE,Shoulder orthosis,"Performance of the upper limb module 2.0 (PUL 2.0), Active Range of motion, Functional workspace, Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), Surface electromyography (sEMG)",,Seoul National University Hospital,,ALL,10 Years,,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,24B-007-0000,,2024-04-20,2025-12-31,2025-12-31,2024-04-12,,2024-06-21,2024-11-21T07:18:56.998255
