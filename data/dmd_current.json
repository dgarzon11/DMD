Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently."
