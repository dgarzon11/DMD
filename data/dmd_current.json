        "briefSummary": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive inherited disease that affects the muscles and causes functional limitations to varying degrees. It is vital to start physiotherapy follow-ups immediately after diagnosis. Patients with DMD are among the most vulnerable groups who have problems in accessing physiotherapy services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the telerehabilitation program developed to protect the physical health of patients with DMD and not to interrupt their follow-up.",
        "detailedDescription": "Forty two patients with DMD were included in the study. 30 of them were ambulant in group 1, and 12 were non-ambulant in group 2. Physiotherapy assessments were performed blindly before the program started. According to the functional levels of the individuals, 2 groups were formed. 9 physiotherapists applied the tele-rehabilitation program for 24 session (3 days in a week)."
