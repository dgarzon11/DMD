The main questions it aims to answer are:
* What is the impact of the muscle-mimicking, fabric-type shoulder orthosis on upper limb functional movements in patients with neuromuscular disorder?
* Are there observable differences in upper limb function when the shoulder orthosis is worn versus when it is not?
Participants will:
* Receive education on how to wear and use the shoulder orthosis.
* Undergo evaluations, including assessment of upper limb performance, shoulder muscle strength testing, active range of motion measurements, assessment of functional workspace, goal attainment scale evaluation, surface electromyography, physiological measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate, fatigue assessment, and assessment for any musculoskeletal or skin-related issues.
Researchers will compare neuromuscular disorder patients before and while wearing and operating the shoulder orthosis to see if there are any significant effects on variables such as upper limb function, range of motion, functional workspace, goal attainment scale, and surface electromyography.","The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the effect of a muscle-mimicking, fabric-type shoulder orthosis on functional movements of the upper limb in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
