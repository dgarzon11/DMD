NCT01451281,2025-09-01 07:24:20.662060,2025-08-25 07:25:05.214668,Brief Summary,"Background:
\- Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease in which the muscles are unable to make the protein dystrophin. Without this protein, the muscles become gradually weaker. A new medicine called GSK2402968 is being tested to see if it can help prevent or slow down this loss of muscle strength. In this study, boys with DMD and healthy volunteers will have different types of imaging studies to see which ones provide the best images of the muscles. This information will help researchers use these imaging techniques to test the safety and effectiveness of GSK2402968 and other agents.
Objectives:
\- To test magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound techniques that can detect changes in muscles of boys with DMD.
Eligibility:
* Boys who have DMD and are in the GSK2402968 drug test study.
* Healthy boys of the same age as the above study participants.
Design:
* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.
* Healthy volunteers will have one 2-hour visit with three tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the skeletal muscles and heart and diaphragm muscles will be carried out. Muscle ultrasound imaging of leg and arm muscles will also be done. Participants should not perform heavy physical activity like school sports or long walks during the week before the visit.
* Participants in the GSK2402968 study will have the same series of tests as the healthy volunteers. The tests will be given during the study screening phase. They will be repeated after 3 months and 6 months of receiving the study agent (GSK2402968 or placebo) and at 6 months after stopping the GSK study.","Background:

\- Children with Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DBMD) slowly lose muscle function. They usually die at a young age. Some mothers adapt to the demands of caring for a child with this disease better than others. Studies show that a person s hope may positively affect how they cope and adapt. Researchers want to find out more about this. They want to develop ways to improve caregivers overall wellness.
Objective:
\- To study the relationships between uncertainty, hope, and coping ability in mothers of children with DBMD.
Eligibility:
\- Women in the United States 18 years and older. They must be biological mothers of a living child with DBMD and be able to answer a survey in English.
Design:
* This study is part of a larger study that examines the well-being of mothers with sons who have DBMD.
* Participants will take a questionnaire. The questionnaire can be done on paper or on a computer. It will take 30 45 minutes to complete.
* The questionnaire will include basic demographic questions about the participant and the child. There will also be questions about how the participant copes with the stress and uncertainty of DBMD.
* For most of the questions, participants will rate their feelings on a scale. There will also be four open-ended questions.","Background:

NCT06755138,2025-09-01 07:24:20.662060,2025-08-25 07:25:05.214668,Brief Summary,"* Objective:
The objective of this observational study is to evaluate and quantify trunk muscle compensatory movement patterns in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) using computer vision technology. Additionally, the study seeks to explore the relationship between these compensatory patterns and scoliosis, upper limb function, pain levels, and quality of life during functional upper limb movements.
* Key Research Questions:
  1\) Can trunk compensatory movement patterns be accurately measured using computer vision analysis? 2) Are these compensatory patterns correlated with scoliosis, upper limb function levels, pain, and quality of life? 3) Do these patterns and their correlations change over time?
* Methodology:
  1. Participants: Patients diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will be recruited for this study.
  2. Assessments:
* Scoliosis Evaluation:
  1. Cobb angle measurement via X-ray imaging.
  2. Upper Limb Function Assessment:
  3. Performance of the Upper Limb Module 2.0 (PUL 2.0).
  4. Brooke Upper Extremity Functional Classification Score.
  5. Korean version of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Functional Ability Self-Assessment Tool (K-DMDSAT).
* Pain Measurement:
  1. Korean version of the PainDETECT Questionnaire (KPD-Q).
  2. Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire.
  3. Quality of Life Assessment:
* Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Quality of Life Questionnaire (DMD-QoL).
  1. Trunk Compensation Analysis:
* Surface electromyography (sEMG) to measure muscle activation.
* Video analysis using computer vision to quantify trunk compensatory movement patterns.
* The following tasks will be evaluated using the dominant arm for sEMG and video analysis:
  i. Pouring water into a cup. ii. Lifting a cup to drink water. iii. Grooming the front of the hair. iv. Moving small blocks within one minute (Box and Block Test). v. Reaching toward nearby objects in the front, left, and right directions.
* Front: Directly in front of the participant's line of sight.
* Left and right: Approximately 45 degrees to the left and right from the participant's front.
* Nearby objects: A water bottle or cup weighing approximately 250g, placed at arm's length.
vi. Reaching toward distant objects in the front, left, and right directions.
* Distant objects: A water bottle or cup weighing approximately 250g, placed at 1.5 times the participant's arm length.
* The sEMG attachment sites are as follows:
  i. Muscles for assessing upper limb functional movements:
  1. Deltoid
  2. Pectoralis major
  3. Trapezius
  4. Biceps brachii ii. Muscles for assessing trunk compensatory actions:
  <!-- -->
  1. Sternocleidomastoid
  2. Longissimus muscle
  3. External oblique abdominal muscle","* Objective:
