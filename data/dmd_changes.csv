The trial will explore the safety and efficacy of twenty intravenous administrations of deramiocel, each separated by three months, over a period of approximately 60 months. Following completion of the initial open-label phase (Month 60), subjects who have completed all Month 60 assessments will be eligible to continue into a long-term open label extension (LT-OLE) period and can continue to receive deramiocel once every 3 months until deramiocel is commercially available or the sponsor terminates the study, or the subject withdraws consent or study participation is terminated by the sponsor.
Subjects will undergo a targeted screening during a 30-day screening period, eligible subjects will then undergo baseline safety and efficacy assessments on Day 1 prior to their first infusion of deramiocel.
Subjects will complete trial assessments at Screening; Day 1; Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, and all LT-OLE visits.

The researchers want to: Test how safe ENTR-601-44 is, learn about any side effects, and look at the potential positive effects of ENTR-601-44, compared to placebo. Placebo looks like the investigational medicine but does not contain any active ingredient. In this summary ENTR-601-44 and placebo are both called study treatments.
The study has 2 parts: Part A: to evaluate if ENTR-601-44 is safe and to determine the best dose of ENTR-601-44 for Part B. Part B: to further evaluate the effect and safety of ENTR-601-44 at the dose determined in Part A.
Participants will be able to roll into an open-label treatment period during which the safety and efficacy of extended dosing will be evaluated.
Participants will:
* Receive study treatment in the form of multiple intravenous (IV) infusions (slow injection) into a vein over the course of several weeks in Part A and in Part B
* Visit the clinic regularly for checkups and tests such as: blood and urine tests, physical examinations, questionnaires, and exercise tests. Participants will have a muscle biopsy at the beginning of their participation and after their last dose to allow researchers to compare whether there have been changes in the muscle as a result of the study drug.
Participants are allowed to continue receiving their standard of care therapy for DMD during the study, as long as their health remains stable.","This is a study of the investigational medicine ENTR-601-44 in participants who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic condition.
