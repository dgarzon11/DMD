In studies of mice with this type of muscular dystrophy, gentamicin treatment produced positive changes in muscle tissue.

Patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations by may be eligible for this 2-week study. Before starting treatment, patients will have evaluations of muscle strength and general well being. Two muscle tissue samples will be taken by needle biopsy, under local anesthetic and sedation. Because of potential risks of hearing loss and kidney toxicity associated with gentamicin, patients will also have a hearing test and blood and urine tests for kidney function before starting treatment. (Currently, gentamicin is commonly prescribed for serious infections of the lungs, heart, and digestive and urinary tracts; adverse effects of hearing loss and kidney toxicity can occur with excessively high drug doses.)

Patients will be hospitalized during drug treatment. Gentamicin will be given intravenously (through a vein) once a day for 14 days. Blood samples will be collected daily to monitor drug levels and determine dosage adjustments, if necessary. Urine samples will be collected to assess kidney function. Hearing tests will be done on days 7 and 10.

On the last day of the study, hearing, kidney function, and muscle strength will be tested and the results compared with pre-treatment levels. Blood and muscle samples will also be taken again for pre-treatment comparison. Hearing, blood, urine, and muscle strength tests will be repeated one month after treatment ends for comparison with previous results.","This study will evaluate the antibiotic gentamicin for treating patients with muscular dystrophy caused by a specific genetic abnormality known as a nonsense mutation.

Antisense therapy with the use of antisense oligonucleotides (AON) has the potential to restore effectively the production of dystrophin, the defective protein, in \>70% of DMD. This could result in increased life expectancy through improved muscle survival and function. Recent scientific research has demonstrated the potential of this technique to skip mutated dystrophin exons, restore the reading frame and generate functional dystrophin protein. Having demonstrated proof-of-principle in human cell culture and animal model studies, we now intend to determine efficacy and safety of this approach to induce dystrophin exon skipping in children with DMD.

The specific aim of this phase I/II study is to assess efficacy (dystrophin production) and safety of intramuscular administered morpholino oligomer directed against exon 51 (AVI-4658 PMO). We are performing parallel preclinical studies to develop methods of systemic delivery that will be necessary for future phase II/III clinical studies.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle degenerative disorder, arises from mutations in the dystrophin gene.

Only two doses of tadalafil improved muscle blood flow, allowing the dystrophic mice to perform more exercise with less muscle injury. This new short-term clinical trial will move the testing from animals to human patients with Becker muscular dystrophy and examine the effects of acute tadalafil dosing on muscle blood flow during a bout of exercise. Patients will take two doses of tadalafil prior to exercising. Then doctors will measure whether muscles receive increased blood flow and therefore are better protected during exercise.

Scientific Hypothesis: In patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (particularly those with dystrophin gene mutations between exons 41-46), loss of sarcolemmal nitric oxide synthase engenders functional muscle ischemia and thus muscle edema after an acute bout of exercise. The investigators further hypothesize that PDE5A inhibition, which boosts nitric oxide-cGMP signaling, constitutes an effective new countermeasure for these patients.","Summary for Patients: This study, funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Association, is intended to build on recent findings published in the journal Nature showing beneficial effects of tadalafil (also known as Cialis) in mice with an animal version of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.

The investigators will compare the muscles of ambulatory or non-ambulatory boys/men with DMD with muscles of healthy individuals of the same age and monitor disease progression in those with DMD over a 5-10 year period. The amount of muscle damage and fat that the investigators measure will also be related to performance in daily activities, such as walking and the loss of muscle strength. In a small group of subjects the investigators will also assess the effect of corticosteroid drugs on the muscle measurements.

Additionally, the investigators will map the progression of Becker MD following adults with this rare disease. The primary objective is to conduct a multi-centered study to validate the potential of non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor disease progression and to serve as a noninvasive surrogate outcome measure for clinical trials in DMD and BMD.

Both of these conditions have an important common feature: loss of ability to walk because of weakness of the thigh muscles. The investigators plan to do a gene therapy trial to deliver a gene to muscle called follistatin (FS344) that can build muscle size and strength. If successful, the investigators can increase the size of the thigh muscle and potentially prolong a patient's ability to walk. The gene will be carried into the muscle by a virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV). This virus occurs naturally in muscle and does not cause any human disease, setting the stage for its safe use in a clinical trial.

Presently there is no treatment that can reverse Becker muscular dystrophy or sporadic inclusion body myositis. Only supportive care is currently possible.

In this study, subjects with either of these diseases will have shots of the follistatin gene injected directly into thigh muscle on one (first cohort) or both legs (2nd and 3rd cohort). One hundred and eighty days following the gene delivery, the muscle will undergo biopsy to look closely at the muscle to see if the muscle fibers are bigger. Between the time of the gene transfer and the muscle biopsy, patients will be carefully monitored for any side effects of the treatment. This will include an MRI of the thigh muscle before treatment and at day 180 following treatment. Blood and urine tests, as well as physical examination will be done on the subjects during the screening visit and on days 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180 to make sure that there are no side effects from the gene injections. Sutures will be removed 2 weeks post-biopsy.

Additional blood samples will be collected at 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Patients will be seen at the end of 1st and 2nd years for a physical exam, assessment of muscle strength and appropriate blood tests.","The investigators are performing a gene therapy clinical trial in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) patients.

Treatment of pulmonary complications has improved survival; however, heart muscle disease or cardiomyopathy has emerged as a leading cause of death, typically by the third decade.

Consequently, DMD cardiomyopathy frequently goes unrecognized (and untreated) until advanced (and irreversible).

Current DMD cardiovascular care guidelines recommend beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) when decreased ejection fraction (EF) is noted by echocardiography (echo); however, this strategy has not significantly improved outcomes. Our team has recently made a breakthrough in a mouse study, showing in a model that causes the same heart muscle disease in humans with DMD adding an old medicine traditionally used for high blood pressure and late-stage heart failure can actually prevent heart muscle damage. Because of this drug's proven safety in both children and adults, it is ready to be studied immediately in an RCT in patients with DMD to hopefully show, as we did in mice, that we can prevent the devastating consequences of heart muscle damage.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common muscular dystrophy, leads to skeletal and cardiac muscle damage.

Consequently they do not have the strength to generate the minimum flow of 160 to 300 liters/minute for an efficient cough function. The restricted cough function allows secretion to accumulate, which in turn causes narrowing of the airway lumen and makes ventilation of the neuromuscular patient even more difficult. The patient's susceptibility to infection increases again and the vicious circle repeats itself. Severe secretion retention may even lead to ventilator failure. Effective secretion and cough management instead reduces the risk for stay in hospital. Therefore, secretion and cough management is a mandatory part of the therapeutic concept for treating patients with neuromuscular disease.

The therapeutic efficacy of the Lung Insufflation Assist Maneuver(LIA) integrated in the ventilator VENTIlogic LS-plus manufactured by Weinmann GmbH+Co KG was studied in a pilot study carried out by the Dep. for Pediatric Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine at the University Hospital of Essen/Germany in cooperation with Research \& Development at Weinmann GmbH \&Co KG, Germany . The objective of the pilot study was to examine the therapeutic efficacy of LIAM as a cough support function in patients with neuromuscular disease and indications for mechanical ventilation.

We hypothesized that i) a certain insufflation maneuver pressure may be optimal to achieve the highest individual peak cough flow and ii) that this pressure is below the pressure needed to achieve the maximum insufflation capacity. We define the lowest insufflation capacity at which the best individual PCF can be achieved as optimum insufflation capacity (OIC). The study was performed using two different techniques in order to demonstrate that findings are not dependent on maneuver details but are rather based on effects of maneuver pressure. The protocol was limited to techniques which do not require breath stacking: i) insufflation with an Intermittend Positive Pressure (IPPB) device and ii) with the VENTIlogic LS using LIAM.","Patients with underlying neuromuscular disorder (NMD) often suffer from weakness in the inspiratory and expiratory muscles.

Most of the burden of diarrheal disease is thought to be preventable with improvements in sanitation, water quality, and hygiene. Large scale interventions promoting these behaviours have either not been rigorously tested or have not produced sufficient change to warrant being rolled out at scale.

Research into the determinants of hand washing behaviour has identified disgust and shame as key motivators. Evidence supports the theory that disgust is a natural behavioural reaction to objects carrying disease risk, thus it may act as a key motivator for other health related behaviours such as water treatment. Whether this knowledge can be harnessed to increase the efficacy of hand washing and safe water campaigns in Bangladesh or elsewhere has yet to be rigorously tested.

The investigators will develop an intervention that utilizes disgust and shame eliciting messages to promote hand washing with soap and point of use water treatment in low income housing compounds of urban Dhaka. The investigators will test the efficacy of this intervention against a more traditional public health intervention based on increasing knowledge of health risks and germ transmission using a randomized controlled trial. The study sample will be broken into the following four arms.

1. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment
2. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand Washing
3. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment
4. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand

This design will allow us to compare outcomes for hand washing and water treatment between both standard public health interventions and disgust and shame based interventions as well as test the overall efficacy of the program comparing with the control. Data will be collected from all compounds at baseline, three month midline and at the six month endline giving us the practical and analytical benefits of a longitudinal dataset.

Compounds will participate in interactive, educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion meetings. For the Disgust and Shame group, these meetings will emphasize disgust and shame related to unsafe water and/or hygiene practices, whereas the Standard group's meetings will resemble a more typical public health intervention explaining the risks and methods of contamination.

At the first meeting, compounds will receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based chlorine dispenser model to treat their drinking water. A randomly selected half will also receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based handwashing station. At the end of the month, there will be a sales meeting in which the investigators will measure compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.

In assessing the impact of the interventions, the investigators are primarily interested in whether the prevalences of safe water and hygiene behaviours differ by treatment arm and over time. The best measurements for approximating behaviour prevalence are physical observations (presence of residual chlorine, hand cleanliness inspections), structured observation of behaviour, rapid physical observations (physical state of hardware/drinking water), self-report of water treatment and hand washing behaviour and willingness to pay for necessary products. The investigators will also attempt to measure and track changes in personal determinants of behaviour such as feelings of disgust and shame related to hand washing and water treatment behaviours.","An estimated 2.2 million children under the age of 5 years die from diarrheal disease each year.

The study sample will be broken into the following four arms.
1. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment
2. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand Washing
3. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment
4. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment \& Hand
This design will allow us to compare outcomes for hand washing and water treatment between both standard public health interventions and disgust and shame based interventions as well as test the overall efficacy of the program comparing with the control. Data will be collected from all compounds at baseline, three month midline and at the six month endline giving us the practical and analytical benefits of a longitudinal dataset.
Compounds will participate in interactive, educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion meetings. For the Disgust and Shame group, these meetings will emphasize disgust and shame related to unsafe water and/or hygiene practices, whereas the Standard group's meetings will resemble a more typical public health intervention explaining the risks and methods of contamination.
At the first meeting, compounds will receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based chlorine dispenser model to treat their drinking water. A randomly selected half will also receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based handwashing station. At the end of the month, there will be a sales meeting in which the investigators will measure compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.
In assessing the impact of the interventions, the investigators are primarily interested in whether the prevalences of safe water and hygiene behaviours differ by treatment arm and over time. The best measurements for approximating behaviour prevalence are physical observations (presence of residual chlorine, hand cleanliness inspections), structured observation of behaviour, rapid physical observations (physical state of hardware/drinking water), self-report of water treatment and hand washing behaviour and willingness to pay for necessary products. The investigators will also attempt to measure and track changes in personal determinants of behaviour such as feelings of disgust and shame related to hand washing and water treatment behaviours."

The main objective of this is to validate the use of serum muscle-derived microRNAs as biomarkers of DMD patients (compared with healthy subjects). Secondary objectives are i) to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of these miRNAs and the severity of the dystrophinopathy (DMD vs BMD) and also the progression of the disease (longitudinal study), ii) to assess the specificity of these markers for dystrophinopathy (comparison with other patients with muscular dystrophy), iii) to test candidate miRNAs recently identified but not yet analyzed in the serum of patients.

Over the last 40 years parents have received little guidance on the potential of exercise as a therapeutic strategy to maintain muscle function. It is well known that high intensity exercise and eccentric contractions can result in muscle damage in dystrophic muscle, yet the absence of muscle loading will conversely result in muscle wasting. Recent research in rodent models and milder forms of muscular dystrophy supports earlier studies that resistance exercise may have beneficial effects for maintenance of muscle mass in dystrophic muscle. However, careful and systematic investigation into the safety and feasibility of resistance exercise is needed to consider its implementation in boys with DMD.

The goal of this project is to assess the safety and feasibility of a home based mild to moderate-intensity strengthening exercise program in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Evidence from milder forms of muscular dystrophy and mouse models of DMD suggests that strengthening exercise may be beneficial for these children, but this area has not been adequately explored using human subjects. The results of this study should provide information to assist in the development of scientifically based recommendations concerning optimal exercise parameters for patients with DMD.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating neuromuscular disease that causes muscle breakdown, weakness, and eventual death.

The pathology of DMD is a result of non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression. The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of life from severe heart and lung problems.

In this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.

Tamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:

(i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists in the repair of damaged muscles.

In other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to its dual mechanism of action. Indeed, Tamoxifen was shown to have significant beneficial effects in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Also, a small compassionate cohort of 3 boys, treated for 6 months with Tamoxifen, yielded very encouraging results.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive devastating disease that affects mainly boys, with an incidence of about 1:3,500 live births.

Real users' needs have been identified thought several workshops, and even if the commercial products might assure a benefit to some users and meet most of their requirements, so far a validation of the use of such devices by people with neuromuscular disease is missing.

We aim at field-testing the improvement in arm functions provided by the use of some commercial devices and assessing their impact to users' quality of life and independence. This step is essential to assure a widespread accessibility to these devices for most of the potential users, possibly providing health providers with direction and guidance towards Health Technology Assessment.

Stair climbing / descending activity is a complex activity that requires joint stability, correct muscle synergy and timing. When the literature is examined; It has been observed that the performance of stair climb up and down activity in individuals with neuromuscular disease has been evaluated with various clinical applications. In recent studies, there are surface electromyography (EMG) studies evaluating various aspects of stair climbing and descending activity.

Surface EMG; is a technique for neuromuscular evaluations that is frequently used in both research and clinical applications, noninvasive, and can be used in areas such as neurophysiology, sports science and rehabilitation.

Our study was planned to examine the muscle activations in the lower limb muscles involved in climbing up stairs activity in children with DMD and to compare healthy children with children with DMD and children with different levels of DMD.

Hypothesis originating from the investigation:

H0: There is no difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between level 1 and level 2-3 children with early DMD.

Female carriers may pass on the pathogenic variant to their daughters, resulting in a significant number of female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants. There was a large variability in the severity of symptoms with some being asymptomatic and some having severe symptoms. Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) might explain some of this variability. But now, the underlying cause of the large variability in phenotype is therefore uncertain.

Aim

1. To describe the change over a 6-year follow-up period in the structure and function of the heart and in function and muscle fat fraction in skeletal muscle of DMD/BMD carriers.
2. To explain the relationship between the XCI and the severity of the disease (phenotype).
3. To compare cardiac affection of female carriers of DMD/BMD to patients with BMD using new cardiac MRI techniques (spectroscopy and Dixon sequences).

Methods

This study contains three parts:

Part 1 is a 6-year follow-up on 53 genetically verified female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants initially investigated in 2016-2018 at Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet (Ethical journal no. H-16035677). In this part, the same 53 females will be investigated with the same measurements as 6 years ago to describe the progression of symptoms. All the follow-up results from this study will be compared to the results from 6 years ago.

In Part 2 a muscle biopsy will be taken from 1-3 muscles (see ""3.3.3 Description of outcomes) to investigate the XCI. To correlate the XCI to the phenotype, these patients will also undergo a muscle MRI and a Medical Research Council scale score for muscle strength (MRC).

In Part 3 The cardiac structure and function in patients with BMD will be investigated using a cardiac MRI to compare the findings with that of female carriers. An MRC will carried out to investigate if the heart affection correlates to the muscle affection.

Female carriers can decide whether to participate in Part 1, Part 2, or both. Patient with BMD can only participate in Part 3.","Background Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are X-linked recessive allelic disorders caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene on chromosome Xp21.

Specifically, we aim 1) to describe the progression of motor, respiratory and cardiac function; 2) to enquire if the phenotypic spectrum of Dup2 is milder than classic DMD, 3) to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize DNA breakpoints to correlate with the phenotype; 4) to collect material for future proteomic/transcriptomic studies.

Background/Rationale DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene and in 11% of cases is due to duplications. The most promising therapeutic approaches include mutation-specific therapies. Notably, there is increasing evidence that specific groups of mutations may underlie different disease trajectories compared to the ""average"" DMD population. It is thus mandatory to have more information on genotype-phenotype correlations and patterns of progression related to different genotypes.

Dup2 is the most common DMD duplication and the only one for which a AAV-mediated exon skipping study is ongoing. Despite most case series and databases ascribe Dup2 to severe phenotype, our preliminary findings sustain that these patients have collectively a milder progression of the disease and in 1/3 of cases a significantly milder phenotype. Moreover, our attempts to reveal mechanism involved in attenuating the phenotype would confute the hypothesis of alternative spicing transcripts as previously described for DMD with deletion of exon 2.

Anticipated output We expect that Dup2 patients present a milder DMD phenotype , which might be predicted by genomic studies.","To characterize the clinical phenotype and possible predictive/prognostic factors of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to duplication of exon 2 (Dup2). Specifically, we aim 1) to describe the progression of motor, respiratory and cardiac function; 2) to enquire if the phenotypic spectrum of Dup2 is milder than classic DMD, 3) to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize DNA breakpoints to correlate with the phenotype; 4) to collect material for future proteomic/transcriptomic studies.
Background/Rationale DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene and in 11% of cases is due to duplications. The most promising therapeutic approaches include mutation-specific therapies. Notably, there is increasing evidence that specific groups of mutations may underlie different disease trajectories compared to the ""average"" DMD population. It is thus mandatory to have more information on genotype-phenotype correlations and patterns of progression related to different genotypes.
Dup2 is the most common DMD duplication and the only one for which a AAV-mediated exon skipping study is ongoing. Despite most case series and databases ascribe Dup2 to severe phenotype, our preliminary findings sustain that these patients have collectively a milder progression of the disease and in 1/3 of cases a significantly milder phenotype. Moreover, our attempts to reveal mechanism involved in attenuating the phenotype would confute the hypothesis of alternative spicing transcripts as previously described for DMD with deletion of exon 2.

* Are there observable differences in upper limb function when the shoulder orthosis is worn versus when it is not?

Participants will:

* Receive education on how to wear and use the shoulder orthosis.
* Undergo evaluations, including assessment of upper limb performance, shoulder muscle strength testing, active range of motion measurements, assessment of functional workspace, goal attainment scale evaluation, surface electromyography, physiological measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate, fatigue assessment, and assessment for any musculoskeletal or skin-related issues.

Families may experience many physiological and psychological problems due to the stress and anxiety they experience. In addition, it is seen that families with children with disabilities give up their existing roles, reduce their participation in social activities, and reach stagnation in their social lives. Mothers are affected psychologically more than fathers and feel lonely. It is stated that mothers believe that they cannot afford everything in the face of the responsibilities they carry and accordingly, they experience emotional and psychological problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, absent-mindedness, forgetfulness and tantrums.

Living with a child with a disability causes family members to experience different emotions as mentioned above; families may frequently experience fear, anxiety, guilt, anger and depression. It is reported that mothers of children with DMD experience depression, anxiety about the future and uncertainty more than mothers of healthy children. Families of children with DMD reported that they felt tired and fatigued during the process of caring for the child and had difficulties in participating in social activities and allocating time for themselves. Most of these families stated that they needed psychological and social support. Therefore, it is important to address the psychiatric aspects of families with children with DMD during the disease process. Parental health contributes positively to the health and adaptation of the family in general. Examining the psychiatric symptoms caused by the problems experienced by families related to DMD and how they cope with this stress will be useful in evaluating and addressing these families. In addition, the social support that families with children with disabilities receive from their immediate environment and institutions is also an important issue. It has been reported that social support from relatives, friends, neighbors, organizations and communities increases the psychological resilience levels of families, they feel that they are not alone in the face of problems, and their anxiety levels decrease. In the literature, it is generally mentioned that when the culture of pediatric care is supportive and family-oriented, the care of the patient will undergo a change when transitioning from pediatric care to the adult period. However, studies evaluating the problems experienced by families in the care of patients with DMD, psychiatric symptoms, ways of coping with stress and perceived social support are insufficient. It is important to evaluate the problems experienced by parents in the families of children with DMD in developing skills to cope with the disease process and disease-related problems, and then to provide training in these areas. Because if parents, who are in the role of caregivers, are equipped with knowledge and skills in this context, they will provide better care and be more useful to their children with DMD.

In line with this information, the aim of this study was to evaluate the problems experienced by parents of children with DMD, psychiatric symptoms, coping skills with stress and the level of social support they perceive and to implement a psychosocial support-based psychoeducation program related to these areas.","Having and caring for a child with disabilities brings emotional, social and economic difficulties for many families.

Historically, these disorders are difficult to treat. In the last three decades, there is a great progress in molecular and genetic basis of these disorders; early diagnosis is achievable with proper clinical recognition and advanced genetic testing \[1\].

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular muscular X-linked recessive disorders that belong to a group of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that placed in the middle of short arm of X chromosome \[2\]. Mutation in this gene lead to absence of dystrophin or structural defects of this protein. The lack of functional dystrophin impairs the structure and function of myofibers which are essential for physiological growth of muscle tissue \[3\].

The non-dystrophic myopathies are a group of inherited myopathies defined by distinctive static histochemical and/or characteristic ultrastructural changes on muscle.

The nomenclature of dystrophic myopathies can be confusing as some of them are classified by age of onset of symptoms (e.g., congenital muscular dystrophies), whereas others are classified by distribution of weakness (e.g., limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, distal myopathies, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy), by characteristic clinical features (e.g., myotonic dystrophy), by the name of the causative gene (e.g., GNE-myopathy, dystrophinopathies), whereas others are named after the physician first describing the disease (i.e., Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy or Bethlem myopathy) or can be subdivided in an entirely different way (i.e., the subgroups of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies which were named according to their mode of inheritance and order of publication) \]4\[ Several aspects need to be taken into account in order to establish a clinical diagnosis; these features include but are not limited to the severity of the muscular wasting, as well as its distribution, and the accompanying symptomology, biochemical, hematological, physical, and neurological investigations, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. Moreover, if the gene defect is established, diagnosis can also be confirmed by gene testing \]5\[

Muscle biopsy lacks of typical dystrophic features such as increased conjunctive endomysial tissue, necrosis, and regeneration and shows one or more characteristic histological features. Based in pathological descriptions, the main non-dystrophic myopathies were described during the last century, taking into account the age of onset and the structural or ultrastructural markers \[6\].

Certain genes, in particular those with large sizes (TTN, RYR1, NEB), may present with different clinical and histological phenotypes and therefore their related myopathies be classified within different groups \[7\].

It is useful to know that other genetic myopathies may mimic non-dystrophic myopathies. This is the case of certain metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies that may show very selective muscle weakness. The description of these disorders goes beyond the scope of this chapter. However, it may be useful to take into account at least three examples, Pompe disease, the glycogen storage disorder type II (GSD II), and TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy, because they may present as congenital or later-onset non-dystrophic myopathies, may show particular muscle imaging abnormalities, and may be treatable \[8; 9\].

Understanding the clinical and molecular characteristics of non-DMD is crucial for several reasons. First, accurate diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling and family planning. Second, identification of the specific genetic mutation allows for the potential development of targeted therapies in the future. Finally, characterization of the clinical course of different non-DMD can guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.","Muscular Myopathies are a heterogenous group of inherited muscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness.

The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of a disease-specific, individualized diet on the nutritional status and functional abilities of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. The study will focus on children aged 4-8 years residing in Ankara, Turkey.

Key questions the investigators aim to answer:

Can a tailored dietary intervention improve the nutritional status of DMD patients? Does a specialized diet positively impact the functional abilities of DMD patients, as measured by the North Star Ambulation Assessment (NSAA)? Participants will undergo a comprehensive nutritional assessment, including anthropometric measurements, and will receive individualized dietary counseling. The intervention will focus on optimizing energy, protein, calcium, and fluid intake, as well as addressing the potential side effects of corticosteroid therapy.

The primary outcome measure will be changes in nutritional status, as assessed by anthropometric measurements. Secondary outcome measures will include changes in functional abilities as measured by the NSAA and quality of life assessments.","Brief Summary

The primary objective of the study is to collect longitudinal data on motor and respiratory function in DMD patients from childhood to adulthood.

The secondary objectives of the study include collection of longitudinal data on other aspects of natural history on DMD, including respiratory, cardiac and endocrine complications, neurodiversity (cognitive impairment, neuro-behavioural disorders such as ADHD and autism), changes to bone density and occurrence of fractures, changes to puberty, incidence of scoliosis, unplanned hospital admissions, and quality of life. The study will also collect information on ethnicity.

Participants will attend an annual or bi-annual neuromuscular clinic, and will have a series of assessments and questionnaires with the study team. These include: key medical data, physiotherapy data, respiratory assessments, Quality of Life questionnaires, and DMD questionnaires. Following assessments and questionnaire completion, data is input into the study's tailor-made National Neuromuscular Database.","The goal of this natural history study is to capture the natural history of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in children and adults in the United Kingdom.

The objective of this observational study is to evaluate and quantify trunk muscle compensatory movement patterns in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) using computer vision technology. Additionally, the study seeks to explore the relationship between these compensatory patterns and scoliosis, upper limb function, pain levels, and quality of life during functional upper limb movements.

* Key Research Questions:

  1) Can trunk compensatory movement patterns be accurately measured using computer vision analysis? 2) Are these compensatory patterns correlated with scoliosis, upper limb function levels, pain, and quality of life? 3) Do these patterns and their correlations change over time?
* Methodology:

  1. Participants: Patients diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will be recruited for this study.
  2. Assessments:
* Scoliosis Evaluation:

  1. Cobb angle measurement via X-ray imaging.
  2. Upper Limb Function Assessment:
  3. Performance of the Upper Limb Module 2.0 (PUL 2.0).
  4. Brooke Upper Extremity Functional Classification Score.
  5. Korean version of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Functional Ability Self-Assessment Tool (K-DMDSAT).
* Pain Measurement:

  1. Korean version of the PainDETECT Questionnaire (KPD-Q).
  2. Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire.
  3. Quality of Life Assessment:
* Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Quality of Life Questionnaire (DMD-QoL).

  1. Trunk Compensation Analysis:
* Surface electromyography (sEMG) to measure muscle activation.
* Video analysis using computer vision to quantify trunk compensatory movement patterns.
* The following tasks will be evaluated using the dominant arm for sEMG and video analysis:

  i. Pouring water into a cup. ii. Lifting a cup to drink water. iii. Grooming the front of the hair. iv. Moving small blocks within one minute (Box and Block Test). v. Reaching toward nearby objects in the front, left, and right directions.
* Front: Directly in front of the participant's line of sight.
* Left and right: Approximately 45 degrees to the left and right from the participant's front.
* Nearby objects: A water bottle or cup weighing approximately 250g, placed at arm's length.

vi. Reaching toward distant objects in the front, left, and right directions.

* Distant objects: A water bottle or cup weighing approximately 250g, placed at 1.5 times the participant's arm length.
* The sEMG attachment sites are as follows:

  i. Muscles for assessing upper limb functional movements:
  1. Deltoid
  2. Pectoralis major
  3. Trapezius
  4. Biceps brachii ii. Muscles for assessing trunk compensatory actions:
