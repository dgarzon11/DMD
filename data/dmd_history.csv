NCT02484560,Efficacy of Stem Cell Therapy in Ambulatory and Non-ambulatory Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - Phase 1-2,,UNKNOWN,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked genetic disorder primarily affecting males, resulting in an absence of dystrophin which ultimately leads to progressive muscle degeneration. Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath, and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently.",,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,,,,University of Gaziantep,,,,,,,10,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,TREATMENT,56733164/203,,2015-06,2015-12,2015-12,2015-06-29,,2015-07-01,2024-11-18T15:09:26.709800
NCT05305976,Telerehabilitation in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,Duchenne,COMPLETED,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive inherited disease that affects the muscles and causes functional limitations to varying degrees. It is vital to start physiotherapy follow-ups immediately after diagnosis. Patients with DMD are among the most vulnerable groups who have problems in accessing physiotherapy services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the telerehabilitation program developed to protect the physical health of patients with DMD and not to interrupt their follow-up.,,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,,,,,Karadeniz Technical University,,,,,,,43,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,PREVENTION,KTU_FTR_AE_01,,2021-01-11,2021-11-15,2022-01-01,2022-03-31,,2022-03-31,2024-11-18T15:09:26.709800
