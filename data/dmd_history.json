        "briefSummary": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive inherited disease that affects the muscles and causes functional limitations to varying degrees. It is vital to start physiotherapy follow-ups immediately after diagnosis. Patients with DMD are among the most vulnerable groups who have problems in accessing physiotherapy services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the telerehabilitation program developed to protect the physical health of patients with DMD and not to interrupt their follow-up.",
        "detailedDescription": "Forty two patients with DMD were included in the study. 30 of them were ambulant in group 1, and 12 were non-ambulant in group 2. Physiotherapy assessments were performed blindly before the program started. According to the functional levels of the individuals, 2 groups were formed. 9 physiotherapists applied the tele-rehabilitation program for 24 session (3 days in a week)."

It is vital to start physiotherapy follow-ups immediately after diagnosis. Patients with DMD are among the most vulnerable groups who have problems in accessing physiotherapy services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the telerehabilitation program developed to protect the physical health of patients with DMD and not to interrupt their follow-up.",
        "detailedDescription": "Forty two patients with DMD were included in the study. 30 of them were ambulant in group 1, and 12 were non-ambulant in group 2. Physiotherapy assessments were performed blindly before the program started. According to the functional levels of the individuals, 2 groups were formed. 9 physiotherapists applied the tele-rehabilitation program for 24 session (3 days in a week)."

Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient. Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory.

Patients with DMD are among the most vulnerable groups who have problems in accessing physiotherapy services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of the telerehabilitation program developed to protect the physical health of patients with DMD and not to interrupt their follow-up.",

Physiotherapy assessments were performed blindly before the program started. According to the functional levels of the individuals, 2 groups were formed. 9 physiotherapists applied the tele-rehabilitation program for 24 session (3 days in a week)."

        "briefSummary": "Muscular dystrophies are inherited disorders in which the skeletal and heart muscles become progressively weaker, sometimes leading to permanent disability. Current treatments aim to control symptoms as much as possible, but there is no cure. Gene therapy, in which defective genes causing the disorder are corrected, is a potential treatment option and is in the process of being developed for muscular dystrophies. This study will determine the safety and feasibility of a particular delivery method for gene therapy that could be used in the future to treat people with muscular dystrophies. Only normal saline, and no active treatment, will be used in this study.",
        "detailedDescription": "There are many types of muscular dystrophies, all of which are progressive, degenerative genetic disorders. One type is Becker's muscular dystrophy, which involves slowly worsening muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis and which can lead to cardiomyopathy, deformities, respiratory failure, and permanent disability. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, another type, is also characterized by progressive muscle weakness, first affecting the muscles around the shoulder girdle and hips and possibly affecting other muscles as the disorder progresses. Complications of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can include abnormal heart rhythms, joint contractures, difficulties with activities of daily living, significant loss of mobility, and permanent disability. There is no cure for muscular dystrophies. Current treatments, such as steroids, mobility aids, physical therapy, and respiratory care, can decrease some of the complications, but there is a clear need for a curative therapy.\n\nThe genetic basis of muscular dystrophies is well understood, which makes gene therapy a potential treatment option in the future. A key step in developing gene therapy involves first ensuring safe delivery of genetic material into a single limb of a patient before using active treatment in the patient's entire body. High-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion, in which fluid is forced under high pressure into arm and leg muscles through the veins, has shown the greatest potential as a delivery method. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of this method with normal saline in people who have Becker's muscular dystrophy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n\nParticipation in this study will last up to 4 weeks. At an initial baseline visit, participants will undergo water emersion measurements of their arm and leg, nerve testing, and muscle strength testing. About 1 to 2 weeks later, participants will enter the pediatric intensive care unit for up to 36 hours. During the inpatient stay, participants will undergo the high-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion procedure with normal saline in one of their arms or legs. Throughout the hospital stay, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored. Medication will be available to control any discomfort or pain experienced by participants. Each subsequent participant will receive more fluid pumped at a higher pressure and with a tighter tourniquet than the previous participant, as long as no problems or adverse effects are detected. Some of the participants will undergo an MRI immediately after the perfusion procedure. About 1 to 2 weeks after the inpatient stay, participants will attend a follow-up visit that will include repeat nerve and muscle strength testing, a blood draw, photos of limbs, and an ultrasound of the leg blood vessels if the participant's leg was used during the perfusion procedure."

AOC 1044-CS2 is designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of AOC 1044 on dystrophin protein production in skeletal muscle as well as the long-term safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory efficacy of AOC 1044.\n\nAll participants who enroll in AOC 1044-CS2 will receive active treatment. The treatment period is 2 years with IV dosing every 6 or 8 weeks.\n\nOnce participants have completed active treatment, they will be followed through a 3-month safety follow-up period. The sponsor may extend active treatment beyond 2 years at a future timepoint."

        "briefSummary": "Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X chromosome recessive hereditary disease and mainly characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Glucocorticoid is the only proven effective medicine,while side effects limit its use. Recent studies have shown that the vascular density in the DMD patients' muscle is decreased,so muscle are in ischemic and anoxic. Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) can improve the capable of resistanting ischemia and hypoxia and maybe a potential therapy for DMD patients.\n\nMethods: 100 patients (aged 2 to 6 years)will be divided into two groups(treatment and control groups) randomly. Treatment group will receive an RIPC stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 150 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals) while control group will receive a similar stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 40 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals). Serum kinase level ,Blood levels of myoglobin, Evaluation of motor function(Four steps test;6-minute walking test) and MRI of lower limbs\uff09at 0 days, 3 days, 3months ,6months.\n\nPurpose\uff1a\n\n1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients\n2. To identify the effectiveness of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients."
