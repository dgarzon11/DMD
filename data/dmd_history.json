        "briefSummary": "Muscular dystrophies are inherited disorders in which the skeletal and heart muscles become progressively weaker, sometimes leading to permanent disability. Current treatments aim to control symptoms as much as possible, but there is no cure. Gene therapy, in which defective genes causing the disorder are corrected, is a potential treatment option and is in the process of being developed for muscular dystrophies. This study will determine the safety and feasibility of a particular delivery method for gene therapy that could be used in the future to treat people with muscular dystrophies. Only normal saline, and no active treatment, will be used in this study.",
        "detailedDescription": "There are many types of muscular dystrophies, all of which are progressive, degenerative genetic disorders. One type is Becker's muscular dystrophy, which involves slowly worsening muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis and which can lead to cardiomyopathy, deformities, respiratory failure, and permanent disability. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, another type, is also characterized by progressive muscle weakness, first affecting the muscles around the shoulder girdle and hips and possibly affecting other muscles as the disorder progresses. Complications of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can include abnormal heart rhythms, joint contractures, difficulties with activities of daily living, significant loss of mobility, and permanent disability. There is no cure for muscular dystrophies. Current treatments, such as steroids, mobility aids, physical therapy, and respiratory care, can decrease some of the complications, but there is a clear need for a curative therapy.\n\nThe genetic basis of muscular dystrophies is well understood, which makes gene therapy a potential treatment option in the future. A key step in developing gene therapy involves first ensuring safe delivery of genetic material into a single limb of a patient before using active treatment in the patient's entire body. High-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion, in which fluid is forced under high pressure into arm and leg muscles through the veins, has shown the greatest potential as a delivery method. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of this method with normal saline in people who have Becker's muscular dystrophy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n\nParticipation in this study will last up to 4 weeks. At an initial baseline visit, participants will undergo water emersion measurements of their arm and leg, nerve testing, and muscle strength testing. About 1 to 2 weeks later, participants will enter the pediatric intensive care unit for up to 36 hours. During the inpatient stay, participants will undergo the high-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion procedure with normal saline in one of their arms or legs. Throughout the hospital stay, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored. Medication will be available to control any discomfort or pain experienced by participants. Each subsequent participant will receive more fluid pumped at a higher pressure and with a tighter tourniquet than the previous participant, as long as no problems or adverse effects are detected. Some of the participants will undergo an MRI immediately after the perfusion procedure. About 1 to 2 weeks after the inpatient stay, participants will attend a follow-up visit that will include repeat nerve and muscle strength testing, a blood draw, photos of limbs, and an ultrasound of the leg blood vessels if the participant's leg was used during the perfusion procedure."

        "briefSummary": "Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X chromosome recessive hereditary disease and mainly characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Glucocorticoid is the only proven effective medicine,while side effects limit its use. Recent studies have shown that the vascular density in the DMD patients' muscle is decreased,so muscle are in ischemic and anoxic. Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) can improve the capable of resistanting ischemia and hypoxia and maybe a potential therapy for DMD patients.\n\nMethods: 100 patients (aged 2 to 6 years)will be divided into two groups(treatment and control groups) randomly. Treatment group will receive an RIPC stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 150 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals) while control group will receive a similar stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 40 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals). Serum kinase level ,Blood levels of myoglobin, Evaluation of motor function(Four steps test;6-minute walking test) and MRI of lower limbs\uff09at 0 days, 3 days, 3months ,6months.\n\nPurpose\uff1a\n\n1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients\n2. To identify the effectiveness of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients."

        "briefSummary": "Muscular dystrophies are inherited disorders in which the skeletal and heart muscles become progressively weaker, sometimes leading to permanent disability. Current treatments aim to control symptoms as much as possible, but there is no cure. Gene therapy, in which defective genes causing the disorder are corrected, is a potential treatment option and is in the process of being developed for muscular dystrophies. This study will determine the safety and feasibility of a particular delivery method for gene therapy that could be used in the future to treat people with muscular dystrophies. Only normal saline, and no active treatment, will be used in this study.",
        "detailedDescription": "There are many types of muscular dystrophies, all of which are progressive, degenerative genetic disorders. One type is Becker's muscular dystrophy, which involves slowly worsening muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis and which can lead to cardiomyopathy, deformities, respiratory failure, and permanent disability. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, another type, is also characterized by progressive muscle weakness, first affecting the muscles around the shoulder girdle and hips and possibly affecting other muscles as the disorder progresses. Complications of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can include abnormal heart rhythms, joint contractures, difficulties with activities of daily living, significant loss of mobility, and permanent disability. There is no cure for muscular dystrophies. Current treatments, such as steroids, mobility aids, physical therapy, and respiratory care, can decrease some of the complications, but there is a clear need for a curative therapy.\n\nThe genetic basis of muscular dystrophies is well understood, which makes gene therapy a potential treatment option in the future. A key step in developing gene therapy involves first ensuring safe delivery of genetic material into a single limb of a patient before using active treatment in the patient's entire body. High-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion, in which fluid is forced under high pressure into arm and leg muscles through the veins, has shown the greatest potential as a delivery method. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of this method with normal saline in people who have Becker's muscular dystrophy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n\nParticipation in this study will last up to 4 weeks. At an initial baseline visit, participants will undergo water emersion measurements of their arm and leg, nerve testing, and muscle strength testing. About 1 to 2 weeks later, participants will enter the pediatric intensive care unit for up to 36 hours. During the inpatient stay, participants will undergo the high-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion procedure with normal saline in one of their arms or legs. Throughout the hospital stay, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored. Medication will be available to control any discomfort or pain experienced by participants. Each subsequent participant will receive more fluid pumped at a higher pressure and with a tighter tourniquet than the previous participant, as long as no problems or adverse effects are detected. Some of the participants will undergo an MRI immediately after the perfusion procedure. About 1 to 2 weeks after the inpatient stay, participants will attend a follow-up visit that will include repeat nerve and muscle strength testing, a blood draw, photos of limbs, and an ultrasound of the leg blood vessels if the participant's leg was used during the perfusion procedure."

        "briefSummary": "Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X chromosome recessive hereditary disease and mainly characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Glucocorticoid is the only proven effective medicine,while side effects limit its use. Recent studies have shown that the vascular density in the DMD patients' muscle is decreased,so muscle are in ischemic and anoxic. Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) can improve the capable of resistanting ischemia and hypoxia and maybe a potential therapy for DMD patients.\n\nMethods: 100 patients (aged 2 to 6 years)will be divided into two groups(treatment and control groups) randomly. Treatment group will receive an RIPC stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 150 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals) while control group will receive a similar stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 40 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals). Serum kinase level ,Blood levels of myoglobin, Evaluation of motor function(Four steps test;6-minute walking test) and MRI of lower limbs\uff09at 0 days, 3 days, 3months ,6months.\n\nPurpose\uff1a\n\n1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients\n2. To identify the effectiveness of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients."

        "briefSummary": "Muscular dystrophies are inherited disorders in which the skeletal and heart muscles become progressively weaker, sometimes leading to permanent disability. Current treatments aim to control symptoms as much as possible, but there is no cure. Gene therapy, in which defective genes causing the disorder are corrected, is a potential treatment option and is in the process of being developed for muscular dystrophies. This study will determine the safety and feasibility of a particular delivery method for gene therapy that could be used in the future to treat people with muscular dystrophies. Only normal saline, and no active treatment, will be used in this study.",
        "detailedDescription": "There are many types of muscular dystrophies, all of which are progressive, degenerative genetic disorders. One type is Becker's muscular dystrophy, which involves slowly worsening muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis and which can lead to cardiomyopathy, deformities, respiratory failure, and permanent disability. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, another type, is also characterized by progressive muscle weakness, first affecting the muscles around the shoulder girdle and hips and possibly affecting other muscles as the disorder progresses. Complications of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can include abnormal heart rhythms, joint contractures, difficulties with activities of daily living, significant loss of mobility, and permanent disability. There is no cure for muscular dystrophies. Current treatments, such as steroids, mobility aids, physical therapy, and respiratory care, can decrease some of the complications, but there is a clear need for a curative therapy.\n\nThe genetic basis of muscular dystrophies is well understood, which makes gene therapy a potential treatment option in the future. A key step in developing gene therapy involves first ensuring safe delivery of genetic material into a single limb of a patient before using active treatment in the patient's entire body. High-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion, in which fluid is forced under high pressure into arm and leg muscles through the veins, has shown the greatest potential as a delivery method. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of this method with normal saline in people who have Becker's muscular dystrophy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.\n\nParticipation in this study will last up to 4 weeks. At an initial baseline visit, participants will undergo water emersion measurements of their arm and leg, nerve testing, and muscle strength testing. About 1 to 2 weeks later, participants will enter the pediatric intensive care unit for up to 36 hours. During the inpatient stay, participants will undergo the high-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion procedure with normal saline in one of their arms or legs. Throughout the hospital stay, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored. Medication will be available to control any discomfort or pain experienced by participants. Each subsequent participant will receive more fluid pumped at a higher pressure and with a tighter tourniquet than the previous participant, as long as no problems or adverse effects are detected. Some of the participants will undergo an MRI immediately after the perfusion procedure. About 1 to 2 weeks after the inpatient stay, participants will attend a follow-up visit that will include repeat nerve and muscle strength testing, a blood draw, photos of limbs, and an ultrasound of the leg blood vessels if the participant's leg was used during the perfusion procedure."

        "briefSummary": "Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X chromosome recessive hereditary disease and mainly characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Glucocorticoid is the only proven effective medicine,while side effects limit its use. Recent studies have shown that the vascular density in the DMD patients' muscle is decreased,so muscle are in ischemic and anoxic. Remote ischemic preconditioning(RIPC) can improve the capable of resistanting ischemia and hypoxia and maybe a potential therapy for DMD patients.\n\nMethods: 100 patients (aged 2 to 6 years)will be divided into two groups(treatment and control groups) randomly. Treatment group will receive an RIPC stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 150 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals) while control group will receive a similar stimulus (inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the bilateral thighs to 40 mm Hg for four 5-minute intervals). Serum kinase level ,Blood levels of myoglobin, Evaluation of motor function(Four steps test;6-minute walking test) and MRI of lower limbs\uff09at 0 days, 3 days, 3months ,6months.\n\nPurpose\uff1a\n\n1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients\n2. To identify the effectiveness of remote ischemic preconditioning for DMD patients."

        "briefSummary": "Background Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are X-linked recessive allelic disorders caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene on chromosome Xp21. Female carriers may pass on the pathogenic variant to their daughters, resulting in a significant number of female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants. There was a large variability in the severity of symptoms with some being asymptomatic and some having severe symptoms. Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) might explain some of this variability. But now, the underlying cause of the large variability in phenotype is therefore uncertain.\n\nAim\n\n1. To describe the change over a 6-year follow-up period in the structure and function of the heart and in function and muscle fat fraction in skeletal muscle of DMD/BMD carriers.\n2. To explain the relationship between the XCI and the severity of the disease (phenotype).\n3. To compare cardiac affection of female carriers of DMD/BMD to patients with BMD using new cardiac MRI techniques (spectroscopy and Dixon sequences).\n\nMethods\n\nThis study contains three parts:\n\nPart 1 is a 6-year follow-up on 53 genetically verified female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants initially investigated in 2016-2018 at Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet (Ethical journal no. H-16035677). In this part, the same 53 females will be investigated with the same measurements as 6 years ago to describe the progression of symptoms. All the follow-up results from this study will be compared to the results from 6 years ago.\n\nIn Part 2 a muscle biopsy will be taken from 1-3 muscles (see \"3.3.3 Description of outcomes) to investigate the XCI. To correlate the XCI to the phenotype, these patients will also undergo a muscle MRI and a Medical Research Council scale score for muscle strength (MRC).\n\nIn Part 3 The cardiac structure and function in patients with BMD will be investigated using a cardiac MRI to compare the findings with that of female carriers. An MRC will carried out to investigate if the heart affection correlates to the muscle affection.\n\nFemale carriers can decide whether to participate in Part 1, Part 2, or both. Patient with BMD can only participate in Part 3.",
        "detailedDescription": "Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are X-linked recessive allelic disorders caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene on chromosome Xp21. The gene mutation causes the absence or very severe reduction of dystrophin protein in the muscle cells, triggering chronic myofiber damage, inflammation, and loss of muscle fibers. Muscle tissue is replaced by fibrous and adipose tissue which further leads to necrosis, progressive muscle weakness, and loss of independent ambulation \\[1\\].\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the commonest inherited disorders of muscle. Based on a systematic review of worldwide population-based studies the pooled prevalence of DMD and BMD was 4.78 (95% CI 1.94-11.81) and 1.53 (95% CI 0.26-8.94) per 100,000 males respectively \\[2\\].\n\nThe disorders preferentially affect males due to the X-linked inheritance. Female carriers may pass on the pathogenic variant to their daughters, resulting in a significant number of female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants. A third of all new cases are caused by de novo pathogenic variants \\[3\\].\n\nEven though female carriers have one healthy X-chromosome, they are not necessarily asymptomatic as both muscular and cardiac involvement has been reported in carriers \\[4-12\\]. These females are classified as \"manifesting carriers\" \\[13,14\\]. The incidence of skeletal muscle involvement among female carriers of DMD was 2.5%-19%, and of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 7.3%-16.7% for DMD carriers and 0%-13.3% for BMD carriers \\[2\\], but in one of the latest cross-sectional studies with some of the most sensitive outcome measures to date 81 % showed muscle affection \\[4\\] and 62 % cardiac dysfunction \\[15\\]. Since then, cardiac MRI techniques have been further developed, why the numbers might be even higher. Patients with BMD have not even been investigated with these techniques. Cardiomyopathy in female DMD and BMD carriers can be clinically significant. Therefore, adult unaffected dystrophinopathy carriers are recommended to undergo echocardiography every 5 years according to the clinical guidelines in Europe and the United States \\[16,17\\]. Carriers with cardiac affection are often examined even more frequently. However, no one has yet investigated the rate of progression, which can make it difficult to determine the frequency of clinical visits.\n\nIn the above-mentioned studies, there was a large variability in the severity of symptoms with some being asymptomatic and some having severe symptoms. Skewed X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) might explain some of this variability. When the X chromosome carrying the normal DMD gene is preferentially inactivated this will in theory lead to moderate-severe muscle involvement.\n\nSome studies have observed that DMD carriers with moderate/severe muscle involvement, exhibit a moderate or extremely skewed XCI, in particular, if presenting with an early onset of symptoms, while DMD carriers with mild muscle involvement present a random XCI \\[4, 18\\]. However, former studies have generally had a low power, investigated the XCI in blood and not muscle, and have often not investigated asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients. Some studies are inconclusive and some even contradictory and therefore no conclusions can be made \\[18\\]. Thus, the underlying cause of the large variability in phenotype is therefore uncertain.\n\n2.2 Aim\n\nThe aims of this study are thus:\n\n1. To describe the change over a 6-year follow-up period in the structure and function of the heart and in function and muscle fat fraction in skeletal muscle of DMD/BMD carriers.\n2. To explain the relationship between the XCI and the severity of the disease (phenotype).\n3. To compare cardiac affection of female carriers of DMD/BMD to patients with BMD using new cardiac MRI techniques (spectroscopy and Dixon sequences).\n\n3. Methods 3.1 Study methods\n\nThis study contains three parts:\n\nPart 1 is a 6-year follow-up on 53 genetically verified female carriers of pathogenic DMD variants initially investigated in 2016-2018 at Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet (Ethical journal no. H-16035677). In this part, the same 53 females will be investigated with the same measurements as 6 years ago to describe the progression of symptoms. All the follow-up results from this study will be compared to the results from 6 years ago.\n\nIn Part 2 a muscle biopsy will be taken from 1-3 muscles (see \"3.3.3 Description of outcomes) to investigate the XCI. To correlate the XCI to the phenotype, these patients will also undergo a muscle MRI and a Medical Research Council scale score for muscle strength (MRC).\n\nIn Part 3 The cardiac structure and function in patients with BMD will be investigated using a cardiac MRI to compare the findings with that of female carriers. An MRC will carried out to investigate if the heart affection correlates to the muscle affection.\n\nFemale carriers can decide whether to participate in Part 1, Part 2, or both. Patient with BMD can only participate in Part 3."
